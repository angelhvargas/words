FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
FADE IN ON:
A GREEN EYE
We move towards its pupil.
EXT. SKIES OVER GROUND. DAY.
SOARING OVER
AN INFINITE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE OF SOLAR PANELS AND PLASTIC
SHEETING. All dead and abandoned to the dust and wind.
Finally giving way to --
EXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA. DAY.
Called farm only generously. The ground dry, inhospitable.
A dubious horizon to distinguish the browns that are both
Earth and sky. There is no green in sight.
The landscape streaks by in a blur. Nothing to tame our
focus until... REVEAL:
A SPINNER
Beaten, scuffed, yet owns the sky like a seagull. It flits
RIGHT BY US, as we MOVE INSIDE --
INT. SPINNER.
THE PILOT IS ASLEEP. The Spinner on autopilot. The MAP on
the dash is abruptly interrupted by A CHIME.
The pilot wakes. Yawns.
This is K. You’d peg him for 30 if you didn’t know better.
Refined features, flawless skin. Intelligent eyes that
breathe in detail and exhale warmth. Gifted with a grin that
masks wry for earnest.
SHAPES begin to coalesce ahead in the distance. Revealing
themselves to be PLASTIC GREENHOUSES.
K’s eyes go hard at seeing a strange INSTALLATION ahead.
K directs the Spinner towards...
EXT. FARMLAND. CALIFORNIA. DAY.
TRAVELLING WITH THE SPINNER over remains of abandoned
greenhouses. PLASTIC DOMES over what were once POOLS.
A windmill stands above it all. Slowly, creakily rotating.
Its bent wing hitting the center pole as it strikes 6
o’clock... creakCLACK... creakCLACK... creakCLACK...
1.
The Spinner’s SHADOW rolls over the windmill. Approaching --
EXT. FARMHOUSE. DAY.
Cement walls and corrugated tin roof. An old school maybe.
Beside it a PLASTIC TENTED POOL.
INT. TENTED POOL. DAY.
Under a translucent dome. A bull of a FARMER stands knee
deep in a pool full of sludge, raking a nutrient rich
solution. Bio-reactors slowly filtered the fluid into
vertical plasmid sacs that feed into LARGE BINS.
The Farmer wears thick protective gear from head to toe.
Hood and goggles cover his face. He takes up a handful of
NEMATODES, pleased with his crop. Looks up as --
THE SPINNER SOARS OVERHEAD.
The Farmer sets down his rake.
EXT. FARMHOUSE.
The Spinner lands in the open field behind the house, kicking
up a PLUME of DUST that briefly obscures it.
A small flitty HOVERCRAFT ejects itself from the back of the
Spinner, A PILOTFISH.
K emerges from the dust. Whatever color his coat was, it’s
brown now. K instructs with the Pilotfish with a gesture. It
TAKES OFF.
K approaches the peeling-paint farmhouse. ONE TREE in sight,
a giant, DEAD, leafless thing. A ghost of grandiosity,
standing only thanks to a brace and wires staked down.
INT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.
K crosses creaking floors. Looks around: Kalsomined walls,
pitted windows. All old, but clean. Someone takes pride.
Basic furniture, an UPRIGHT PIANO. Otherwise EMPTY. No
decor, shelves BARE.
K inspects the few items. Sheet music for CHOPIN on the
piano. An aquarium in which COWSLIPS grow...
A pot of something fragrant simmers on the stove... K leans
into the pot, sniffs deeply, when --
HEAVY FOOTSTEPS come from outside. Rattling the whole house.
K re-lids the pot, as --
2.
EXT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUS.
The Farmer approaches his home. Air HISSES in at the
unfastening of his MASK. He eyes the Spinner parked beyond
the tree. Sees the Pilotfish hovering above. Pulls a chain.
A DECONTAMINATION SHOWER rains over his suit, which he can
now unsnap.
This is SAPPER MORTON. Weathered 60s. A well-broken nose.
Yet he pulls from his belt satchel a set of dainty glasses.
INT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUS
THE DOOR OPENS. Sapper steps in. The floor creaks under his
weight.
He scans the room. Empty. Sapper moves to a sink where he
violently scrubs his hands. He does not yet see K.
K leans from a shadow into the light. A stranger, suddenly
visible. Briefly ominous. An uncertain moment...
K
(polite)
Hope you don’t mind me taking the
liberty. Wind’s a bit unkind out there.
I was careful not to track in any dirt.
Sapper eyes K’s chummy posture. Dismisses any threat.
SAPPER
I do not mind dirt. I do mind
unannounced visits. You police?
K
Sapper Morton... Civic number NK680514?
SAPPER
I’m a farmer.
K
(genuinely interested)
I saw that. What do you farm?
SAPPER
This is a protein farm. Wallace design.
Sapper fishes a clod off his boot and pulls off a single
wriggling WORM.
SAPPER (cont’d)
It only takes the one to start.
Parthenogenic strain. Constant doubling.
They’ll fill as much dirt as you can wet.
3.
K
Is that what I smell?
K looks to that inviting pot on the stove. Sapper shakes his
head, pleased with himself. Opens a cupboard, where a grow
light nourishes PLANTS. A few FLOWERS. And a bottle
terrarium full of GREEN SHOOTS.
SAPPER
Grow this just for me. Garlic.
K
Garlic.
He looks. The pot on the stove bubbles and steams.
SAPPER
Whole town farmed it back once. Smelled
this good a hundred miles in circle.
Try some?
K
No thank you. I prefer to keep a cold
stomach until the hard part of the day’s
behind me. How long you been here?
SAPPER
Since ’20. Came by it honest too if
that’s what you’re after.
K
But you weren’t a farmer prior.
Sapper cocks his head at the comment. K notes the SATCHEL at
his belt.
K (cont’d)
That bag... colonial medical use, isn’t
it? Military issue. Heat resistant.
Where were you... Calantha? Must’ve
been brutal. Not many who survived
bothered to come back to ground.
A beat. Sapper’s expression darkens. He takes off his
glasses puts them in his satchel.
SAPPER
Planning on taking me in? Huh? Take a
look inside. See what they missed.
REVEAL: Sapper has A SCALPEL from his satchel. Not likely.
K
If taking you in is an option, I’d much
prefer that over the alternative.
4.
K puts his gun on the table.
K (cont’d)
You had to know it’d be someone in time.
Sorry it’s me.
K stands and retrieves a small SCANNER from his pocket.
SAPPER
Good as any.
K activates the scanner.
K
If you’d look up and to the left please.
The FIGHT is quick and it is fierce:
Sapper stabs towards K’s heart. K avoids the blade, only his
coat and the wall are pierced by Sapper’s knife now stuck
deep into the wall. K breaks Sapper’s hold on the knife,
which skids to the floor.
K DUCKS a heavy fist that sinks into the wall where his head
just was. Sapper grabs K by his belt and collar, lifting him
into the air and slamming him into the wall over and over --
until K’s body GOES THROUGH IT, and --
K crashes onto the floor in the next room.
K recovers quickly, strangely able to withstand the
punishment. He sees Sapper charge through the wall to finish
the job.
Sapper is on him -- a vice lock around K’s throat -- K
gasping for air.
K gets out of Sapper’s grip, and lashes out in rapid
succession, his solar plexus, his chin, his throat, crushing
his windpipe. His blows are SURGICAL, anatomically precise,
like viper bites.
Sapper is stunned, choking, in pain. K kicks Sappers’ knee
and the giant drops to the floor like a felled oak tree.
K SNATCHES Sapper’s THROAT -- SQUEEZING -- thumb SLIDING
UPWARD as -- Sapper GASPS... FLAILS... hand reaching...
For the dropped SCALPEL... GRASPING IT!
HE STABS K in the SHOULDER.
K accepts the wound and the pain. Only squeezes tighter.
